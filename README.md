# Enrichment-Analysis-of-Ion-Channels

## Introduction

Ion channels are a category of proteins that reside in the membranes of cells. These proteins possess a hydrophilic pore, allowing ions to transport across a lipid membrane. With a large diversity in structure, ion selectivity and mechanisms responsible for channel opening and closing it is not surprising that these channels carry out a multitude of functions in the body outside of electrical signal transduction! Some of these functions include: muscle contraction, secretion of hormones in the pancreas and electrolyte regulation in the kidneys. 

With approximately 400 ion channel genes in the human genome, I thought it would be interesting to compare their chromosome distribution and tissue expression patterns to all other protein-coding genes in the human genome. 

## Results

**Figure 1 Chromosome distribution of ion channel genes vs other genes.** (A) To obtain % genes reported on the y-axis for the “All ion channel genes” dataset the number of ion channel genes corresponding to a given chromosome is divided by the total number of ion channel genes in all chromosomes multiplied by 100%.

**Figure 2 Tissues enriched in ion channel genes vs other genes.** Fisher’s exact test was done followed by the Bonferroni correction to identify tissues in which ion channel genes are enriched (red star, p < 0.05).
